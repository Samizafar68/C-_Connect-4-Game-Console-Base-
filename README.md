# Connect 4 Game 🎮

A **C++ implementation** of the **classic Connect 4 game**, where two players take turns dropping tokens into a vertical grid. The first player to align four tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game(You can Play in Easy,Medium,Hard mode). The project incorporates fundamental programming concepts such as loops, functions, arrays, and file handling.

## 📌 Features

- **Player vs. Player Mode** 🆚
  - Player 1 uses **'X'** token.
  - Player 2 uses **'O'** token.

- **Game Functions** 🛠️
  - `play_game()`: Displays the main menu and lets users choose game modes.
  - `credits()`: Displays project creators.
  - `instructions()`: Explains game rules.
  - `score()`: Keeps track of games won by Player 1, Player 2, and drawn matches.

- **Game Mechanics** ⚙️
  - **Toss Function (`toss()`)**: Determines which player goes first.
  - **Turn-Based Play (`player_turn()`)**: Switches between players after each valid move.
  - **Winning Condition (`winning_condition()`)**: Checks if a player has connected four tokens.
  - **Lose & Draw Conditions (`lose_condition()`, `draw_condition()`)**: Detects game-ending scenarios.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Development Environment**: Microsoft Visual Studio
- **Key Concepts Implemented**:
  - **Control Structures**: Loops & Conditional Statements
  - **Functions**: Modular approach with reusable functions
  - **Arrays**: Multi-dimensional array for game board
  - **File Handling**: Storing game scores
  - **Proper Code Indentation**: Improves readability
